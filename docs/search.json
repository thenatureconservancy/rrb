The Developed EVTs of high, medium, and low intensity, and Quarries-Strip Mines-Gravel Pits EVTs were combined into one “Developed” EVT.

Find BpS descriptions for your area here.\nCheck out the vegetation modeling website to learn how to integrate BpS into your work.\nRead Blankenship et al. (2021) to learn how the models and descriptions were developed."
